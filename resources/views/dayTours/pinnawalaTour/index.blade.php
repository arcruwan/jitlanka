                        The orphanage is currently home to large number of elephants, including a number of baby elephants.
                        Visitors to the orphanage can watch the elephants as they are fed and bathed during their daily walk
                        to the nearby river. <br><br>
                        The orphanage is involved in a number of conservation and research projects, aimed at protecting the
                        Asian elephant and their habitat. It is also dedicated to providing care for injured and sick
                        elephants. <br><br>

                        the plight of the Asian elephant. <br><br>

                        about Sri Lanka's elephants and the conservation efforts being made to protect them. It's also a

                    <p class="textModelpara"> The Peradeniya Royal Botanical Gardens, also known as the
                        Royal Botanic Garden, Peradeniya, is a world-known botanical garden located in the city of Kandy,
                        Sri Lanka. It was established during the 14th century AD as a Royal pleasure garden. It was
                        converted to a Botanical Garden by the British in the 19th century. The Royal Botanical Garden is
                        the largest botanical garden in the country which has spread over 147 acres and is home to over 4000
                        species of plants. They include rare and endemic species which only could be found on the Royal
                        Botanical Garden premises. <br><br>
                        The garden features lush green lawns, tranquil lakes, and stunning flower gardens, making it a
                        peaceful oasis in the heart of the city. The structures of the Royal Botanical Garden are believed
                        to contain some symbolic elements that represented British Rule as well. Visitors can admire the
                        beauty of the botanical specimens and take a leisurely stroll through the garden or simply relax in
                        the tranquil surroundings. No matter whether you're a botanist, a nature lover, or simply looking
                        for a peaceful place to relax, the Peradeniya Royal Botanical Gardens will be the best place where
                        you must be.<br><br>
